# Pratilipi recommendation


The methodology of the recommendation system is based on the expected class's probability score. As the machine learning predicts the expected predicted class with the highest probability, we can take out the top 5 scores for recommending the best possible pratilipi category based on provided input. 


Several models were implemented for the proposed methodology. Dataset was split intro training and testing having 75% and 25% respectively. In the end random forest classifier gave us approximately a better recommendation prediction. Random forest is an assembling technique that combines multiple decision trees to find optimal prediction. 

Libraries used for proposed methodology

```
numpy
scipy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
pandas
seaborn
datetime
keras
tensorflow
```
